## Summary
PawPics is an app for finding a home for pets in need as fast as possible.  This app follows the models of some dating apps, and what is the purpose of a dating app?
The purpose of a dating app is to get the users paired up with a compatible partner as fast as possible.  So this app is going to be designed to get homeless pets with a
caring family ASAP.

The user will be greeted with a screen with a form so the app can get input about what pet a person is looking for.  After this step the app will pull from the PefFinder API a pic and
info about a random pet.  The user will then be prompted to give a yes or no based on the pet location and other info if the pet is a good fit for the user.

If the pet is found to be a good fit for the user, the user can then add the pet to favorites and or get in direct contact with the person responsible for the adoption process.
